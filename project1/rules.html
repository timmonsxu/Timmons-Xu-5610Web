      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Battleship</span> (also known as Battleships) is
        a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled
        grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are
        marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.
        Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and
        the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is played on four grids, two for each player. The grids are
        typically square, usually 10Ã—10, and the individual squares in the grid
        are identified by letter and number. On one grid the player arranges
        ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid, the
        player records their own shots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their
        primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the
        grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares
        for each ship is determined by the type of ship. The ships cannot
        overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid) or
        be placed diagonally. The types and numbers of ships allowed are the
        same for each player. These may vary depending on the rules. The ships
        should be hidden from the opposing player's sight and players are not
        allowed to see each other's pieces. The game is a discovery game in
        which players need to discover their opponent's ship positions.
