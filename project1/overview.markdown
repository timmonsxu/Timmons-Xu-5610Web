# Project Reflection

## 1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?

Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  
How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging part of this assignment was adjusting **size and position** using CSS. While I had already learned the basic syntax of CSS, I found that different CSS properties can sometimes **conflict with each other** or have **unexpected behaviors**, which can only be fully understood through trial and error. After finishing the HTML structure, I found writing the CSS **quite difficult**.

Overall, this project took me **three days** to complete, with an estimated **12-15 hours** of actual work. This might be due to my lack of familiarity with some **CSS fundamentals**, which required me to frequently look up syntax while coding.

## 2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile-friendly?

At first, I was quite **confused** because designing for **desktop and mobile** feels very different. Even though we learned **responsive design** in class, I found that actually implementing it was **not easy**. Eventually, I decided to **focus on the desktop version first**, as I had more reference points to work with.

However, I noticed that if I only focused on the desktop version, the **final mobile layout** would often look **disorganized**, making it difficult to adjust. To solve this, I **structured my CSS based on element groupings** and wrote many `@media` queries to keep **related elements together**. This approach made my CSS **much cleaner and easier to manage**.

## 3. What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?

Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?

First, I’m **proud of my chessboard implementation** on the **gaming page**. The hover effect is **only applied to unselected cells**, meaning **already interacted cells cannot be selected again**, which makes the UI clearer.

Second, I’m **happy with the typography choices**. I deliberately selected **futuristic fonts** to match the theme, and I think they complement the game aesthetic well.

Lastly, I put **a lot of thought into color choices** and used **various shades of blue**. However, I feel that my current color palette **could be improved to feel more “game-like”**. Additionally, I planned my design by identifying which elements should have **fixed positions** and which should be **adaptive**, making my coding process more structured.

## 4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?

I would **add more icons** to enhance the **visual appeal** of my pages. Additionally, I would **spend more time researching similar websites** for inspiration. Right now, I feel like my website **still looks somewhat basic**, and I would like to refine it further.

## 5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

I spent approximately **three days** working on this project, with a total of around **12-15 hours**.

## (Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?

My only assumption was that **the two boards on the gaming page should be displayed together** rather than using some kind of **toggle or page-switching mechanism**.
